# Walking Gait Synthesis and Execution

Getting Poppy to autonomously take a step forward involves two stages:

- Synthesis of the joint trajectory

- Execution of the joint trajectory

Synthesis is done using the code in this repository and execution is done using code in an adjoining repository as described [here](https://github.com/garrettkatz/poppy-muffin/blob/master/scripts/walk.md).
